-- | copied from: pulp purescript rewrite:
-- | Start a child process asynchronously, with the given command line
-- | arguments and environment, and wait for it to exit.
-- | On a non-zero exit code, throw an error.
--
-- | If the executable was not found and we are on Windows, retry with ".cmd"
-- | appended.
-- |
-- | Stdout, stdin, and stderr of the child process are shared with the pulp
-- | process (that is, data on stdin from pulp is relayed to the child process,
-- | and any stdout and stderr from the child process are relayed back out by
-- | pulp, which usually means they will immediately appear in the terminal).
