This is an application that will soon run (on a tiny scale) in production. It's a CRUD application for a domain with around 5 objects.

Aspects:
- Written in PureScript
- Frontend and Backend in one language = "universal"
- Static typing stretching from front to back
- Using optic-ui on frontend
- SQLite Database

Todo:
- Add more CRUD pages
- Add synchronization applications

Test:
    npm run test

Build dev:
    npm run dev

Build prod (needs JAVA, uses closure compiler):
    npm run start
